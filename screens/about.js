              Society has become more mobile and the information held
              electronically about persons and services by government agencies
              and other bodies have substantially increased. There is a growing
              need to integrate the residents of Katsina State into e-government
              initiatives to enable the services provided by government to be
              fully utilised and also provide an accurate picture for government
              policy and planning.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The Katsina State Residents Registration Agency Bill was passed and
              signed into law on the 27th of June 2011.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              The law established LASRRA with the following functions:
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              {`\u25CF`} To create a reliable database of all residents in Katsina
              State.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              {`\u25CF`} To establish the relevant infrastructure for the
              creation of a residents information database.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              {`\u25CF`} To produce guidelines for data to be contained in the
              registration form.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              {`\u25CF`} To advice the government on mode of collecting data
              from the public.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The data collected and collated by the Agency with the residency
              card issued would provide for a reliable method of authenticating
              and identifying residents. It will likewise avail the e-services
              facilities provided by the State.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The Katsina State Residents Registration initiative has the
              potential to address key challenges facing e-government and other
              initiatives. Various e-government initiatives have been enabled to
              collect electronic data and each operates autonomous of each
              other. To provide a more accurate picture for government policies
              and planning, a link must be established between these various
              stores of data.
